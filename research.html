                <h3>Entrapment of CO in CO<sub>2</sub> Ice</h3>
                <p>Planet atmosphere and hydrosphere compositions are fundamentally set by accretion of volatiles, and therefore by the division of volatiles between gas and solids in planet-forming disks. For hyper-volatiles such as CO, this division is regulated by volatile sublimation energies, and by the ability of other ice components to entrap. Water ice is known for its ability to trap CO and other volatile species. In this study we explore whether another common interstellar and cometary ice component, CO<sub>2</sub>, is able to trap CO as well. We measure entrapment of CO molecules in CO<sub>2</sub> ice through temperature-programmed desorption experiments on CO<sub>2</sub>:CO ice mixtures. We find that CO2<sub>2</sub>ice traps CO with a typical efficiency of 40%–60% of the initially deposited CO molecules for a range of ice thicknesses between 7 and 50 monolayers, and ice mixture ratios between 1:1 and 9:1. The entrapment efficiency increases with ice thickness and CO dilution. We also run analogous H<sub>2</sub>O:CO experiments and find that under comparable experimental conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> ice entraps CO more efficiently than H<sub>2</sub>O ice up to the onset of CO<sub>2</sub> desorption at ∼70 K. We speculate that this may be due to different ice restructuring dynamics in H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> ices around the CO desorption temperature. Importantly, in planet-forming disks, the ability of CO<sub>2</sub> to entrap CO may change the expected division between gas and solids for CO and other hyper-volatiles exterior to the CO<sub>2</sub> snowline. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab32e5">Read more</a>.</p>

                <h3>Entrapment of Hypervolatiles in Interstellar and Cometary H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> Ice Analogs</h3>
                <p>Planets and planetesimals acquire their volatiles through ice and gas accretion in protoplanetary disks. In these disks, the division of volatile molecules between the condensed and gaseous phases determines the quantity of volatiles accreted by planets in different regions of the disk. This division can be strongly affected by entrapment of volatiles into less volatile ice matrices, resulting in different radial profiles of common volatiles and elemental ratios than would otherwise be expected. In this study we use laboratory experiments to explore the ability of abundant interstellar and cometary ice matrices, i.e., H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>, to trap the hypervolatiles <sup>13</sup>CO, <sup>12</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>, and Ar. We measure entrapment efficiencies through temperature programmed desorption for two ice thicknesses (10 and 50 monolayers) and two mixing ratios (3:1 and 10:1) for each matrix:volatile combination. We find that ice entrapment efficiencies increase with ice thickness and ice mixing ratio to a maximum of ∼65% for all hypervolatiles. Entrapment efficiencies are comparable for all hypervolatiles, and for the two ice matrices. We further find that the entrapment efficiency is relatively insensitive to the ice deposition temperature between 10 and 30 K with the possible exception of CH<sub>4</sub> in CO<sub>2</sub> ice. Together these results suggest that hypervolatile entrapment at low temperatures (<30 K) is a remarkably robust and species-independent process. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aceaf8">Read more</a>.</p>

        <h3>Characterizing H-D exchange in UV irradiated water:methane ice mixtures (in prep.) </h3>
        <p>Present-day D/H ratios in cometary water and organics provide clues about the formation environment of the Solar System’s planets and planetesimals, and by extension to the chemistry of planet formation more generally. Decoding these clues is complicated, however, possible by a range of H-D exchange reactions in ice. In particular, H-D exchanges can occur thermally, or through irradiation or atom bombardment. Quantifying the relative importance of these processes for the H/D record requires laboratory experiments. I will present the outcome of one such experiment, focusing on the UV-induced H-D scrambling between water and organics in ice mixtures maintained at different temperatures, ranging from 10 to 70 K. In these experiments D<sub>2</sub>O:CH<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O:CD<sub>4</sub> ices are deposited at ~10 K and subsequently heated to a desired temperature. This is followed by prolonged exposure to UV photons from a well-characterized UV lamp. We use this data to constrain the D-H exchange rate at different ice temperatures, any energy barriers, as well as the steady-state D/H ratio in water and methane under different ice conditions. To gain a deeper understanding of the D-H exchange, we have explored multiple experimental conditions, including different ratios, thicknesses, and the choice between co-deposition and pre-mixed components. We then use these results to discuss the interpretation of observations of D/H in water and small organics within comets.</p>

        <h3>Formation of Deuterated Methanol from Oxygen Insertion (in prep.)</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on the formation of deuterated methanol ices from different O-bearing species. We focus on CH<sub>3</sub>D and O-bearing (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, or oxygen bombardment) under VUV irradiation. The resulting d-methanol could be CH<sub>2</sub>DOH or CH<sub>3</sub>OD, giving us insights into deuterium selection.</p>
